# Pay-Day-Web-App-PHP
A conversion of a Java web application to a PHP one.

This app was written as a way to understand how to create a PHP web application. I took the previously created Java application
and converted it to a PHP one. As this is my first PHP app it is not quite up to production standards, security needs improving
. However, it was a good way to understand the differences of building a PHP app to a Java app. The basic operation of the app is
to allow employees view their monthly salary. There is a login screen with some browser and server side validation. A database
is accessed to check for valid users, then accessed again to present the requested information. This app relies on there being some
data to access, users and some salary information.
